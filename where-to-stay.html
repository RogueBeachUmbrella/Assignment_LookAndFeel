            <h2>Promenade des Anglais</h2>
            <p>
                The most emblematic street in Nice, the Promenade des Anglais is a gorgeous pedestrian area that follows the curve of the Baie des Anges beaches. This legendary seaside road is lined with planted palm trees and filled with elegant gardens. Originally
                just a small footpath, the Promenade des Anglais was developed by Englishman, Reverend Lewis Way in 1820 at his own expense. The road was further enhanced in 1931 when it was given two separate roadways. At the time, Queen Victoria's son,
                the Duke of Connaught, inaugurated the promenade in royal style.

            <h2>Parc de la Colline du Château (Castle Hill Park)</h2>
            <p>
                On a hill overlooking the Nice coastline, the site of Castle Hill was the first area of Nice to be inhabited by the Greeks two millennia ago. Once considered impregnable, the citadel was destroyed by soldiers of the French King Louis XIV in 1706. Now
                the property is set aside entirely as a park. Visitors can arrive at the Colline du Château by foot from the OId Town of Nice or take an Art-Deco lift or escalator from Place Garibaldi. Another option is to take the Little Tourist Train
                that departs at the end of Quai des États-Unis.
