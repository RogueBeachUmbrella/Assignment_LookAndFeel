                    <h2>A little history...</h2>
                    <p>Nice, seaport city, Mediterranean tourist centre, and capital of Alpes-Maritimes département, Provence–Alpes–Côte-d’Azur région, southeastern France. The city is located on the Baie (bay) des Anges, 20 miles (32 km) from the Italian border. Sheltered by beautiful hills, Nice has a pleasant climate and is the leading resort city of the Côte d’Azur, or French Riviera.</p>
                    <p>Founded by the Phocaeans of Marseille (a colony of Greek mariners) around 350 BCE, the city was probably named in honour of a victory (nikē in Greek) over a neighbouring colony. Conquered by the Romans during the 1st century CE, it became a busy trading station. The town was held by the counts of Provence during the 10th century, and in 1388 passed under the protection of the counts of Savoy, who held it until 1860, although it was captured and occupied several times by the French during the 17th and 18th centuries. Nice was ceded to France by the Treaty of Turin (1860), after which a referendum ratified the decision.</p>

                    <h2>How to get to Nice</h2>
                    <p>The wholesome geographical location of Nice turns the city into a destination accessible by air, by land and by sea alike. The closest airport is Nice Cote d’Azur Airport, whereas Port de Nice is the place where ships which crisscross the Mediterranean Sea can haul ashore.</p>
                    <p>Nice also has fine railway connections with cities like Paris, Lyon or Cannes. The so-called La Provencale (A8) is the largest motorway which passes just several kilometers north from Nice, allowing tourists to get here from virtually the entire mainland Europe. Several national and international bus companies offer regular trips to and from Nice, linking the French Riviera to the rest of the country and even to other major European destinations.</p>

                    <h3>By Air</h3>
                    <p>Nice Cote d’Azur Airport is located some 3 kilometers southwest of Nice, and it actually services the tourist platform of the entire French Riviera, Monaco included. It is rated the third busiest airport in France, only after the two airports which enable the passage of the tourist flow to Paris, a feature explainable by the tremendous popularity the French Cote d’Azur enjoys worldwide.
                    <p>The airport transfer means to Nice are fairly reliable, so, in all likelihood, traveling by air is the most straightforward manner of getting to Nice.</p>

                    <h3>By Train</h3>
                    <p>It is precisely this railway terminal that provides the best train connections with other major French cities, such as Paris, Bordeaux or Cannes. Gare de Nice Ville is also a terminal for trains which establish connections between Nice and sundry international destinations (roughly speaking, big European cities).</p>
                    <p>Gare de Nice Ville is fitted for accommodating the passage of TGVs (high speed trains), though the venue keeps a striking historical atmosphere exuded by certain architectural features (mainly, decorations). A tourist information office is located just outside the train station. On top of that, bus no. 99 links the train station to the airport.</p>
                    <p>In order to learn more about the trains which link Nice to the rest of France and Europe, please visit <a href="https://www.sncf.com/fr">www.sncf.com/fr</a></p>

                    <h3>By Bus</h3>
                    <p>There are several companies which provide bus connections between Nice and various French cities, as well as with international destinations. However we recommend our guests to use <a href="https://www.santa-azur.com/fr">Phoceens Santa Azure</a> on your next visit.<p></p>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>By Car</h3>
                    <p><i>La Provencale</i> (the A8 motorway) is the most important thoroughfare passing just nearby Nice, linked to Nice by 5 exits which lead to various areas of the city.</p>

                    <h3>By Boat</h3>
                    <p>Port de Nice is one of the most developed and busiest ports on the French Riviera, being used both to commercial and tourist purposes. It is, so to say, a harbor and a marina at the same time, featuring plenty of leisure opportunities for people who come to Nice either to explore the city in depth or just to search out the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.sncm.fr/">SNCM</a> is one of the ferry companies which link Nice to other destinations on the Mediterranean Sea, focusing on the connections between Corsica, on the one hand, and European and African ports, on the other hand.</p>
